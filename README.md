# Housing-Price-Prediction
This project details the end-to-end creation of a robust Housing Price Prediction Model, demonstrating a complete machine learning workflow from data extraction to model evaluation. Using Python within VS Code and Jupyter Lab, I utilized key libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and joblib.
